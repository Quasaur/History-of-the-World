<p>NOTE: THIS PAGE IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION!</p>
<h1 class="doc">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>My History of the World was begun in 2007 as a project to "accentuate" the historical veracity of the Biblical Narrative. My own interests are quite eclectic; and it has always been my intention in this History to touch every country and tribe in as many subjects and issues as possible.</p>
<p>Obviously such an endeavor is far beyond the capabilities of one person; and so everyone can now contribute to my project.</p>
<h1 class="doc">A. BROWSE</h1>
<p>The Browse tab provides a view of all the current content in the History of the World database.</p>
<h2 class="doc">A.1. Filters</h2>
<p>By default the Browse tab displays all records. The filters allow you to view specific data.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type.</strong> Click on the arrows of the combo box to see the available types of events. The list is dynamic; and changes as more types are added.</li>
<li><strong>Continent.</strong> Click on the arrows of the combo box to see the list of land masses. The list is fixed, and will not be changed. The "Earth" entry is unique in two aspects: (1) It's used primarily for entries that deal with astronomical events (the "Astro" event type); (2) The "Earth" entry doesn't map on the Map tab.</li>
<li><strong>Region.</strong> The Region filter is a text field in which you can type any text word that currently exists in the Region field of the database. For instance: entries that have "Rome, Italy" as the Region can be searched for either as "Rome" or "Italy" (of course typing "Italy" will give you all locations in Italy, including Rome). The Region text field is case-insensitive ("rome" is the same as "Rome"). INCOMPLETE WORDS ARE NOT ACCEPTED ("rom" will not give any results..."Rome" will).</li>
<li><strong>Description.</strong> The Description filter is a text field in which you can type any text word that exists in the Description field of the database. Like the Region field, the Description is case-insensitive; and INCOMPLETE WORDS ARE NOT ACCEPTED.</li>
</ul>
<p>All four filters can be used at the same time. When you have set one or more filters press the Apply button or the Enter key on your keyboard to see the new view of data according to the filters.</p>
<h3 class="doc">A.1.a. Either/Or Filter (';' - Text Fields Only)</h3>
<p>The Either/Or operator (a semi-colon, ';') can be used to filter on MULTIPLE POSSIBLE VALUES in the Region and Description filter fields (i.e., "Birth;Death" to get all births and deaths)</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="doc">A.1.b. Filters Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>It's important to remember that, if you're using MORE THAN ONE FILTER, the application with attempt to locate data that meets ALL the filter criteria.</p>
<h2 class="doc">A.2. Fields</h2>
<p>Following are descriptions for the fields used in my History of the World.</p>
<h3 class="doc">A.2.a. Bible Year</h3>
<p>The Bible Year is calculated based on the work of <a href="http://www.bibletime.com/tool/time/gregorian" target="_blank">Phil Stone</a>. Year One of the Bible Calendar is (allegedly) the creation of Adam.</p>
<h3 class="doc">A.2.b. Gregorian Year</h3>
<p>The modern calendar in use throughout most of the world today is the Gregorian calendar, named after the Pope who introduced it in 1585. It was not adopted in the United States until an act of the English Parliament made it law throughout the English Empire in 1752. Since that time most other countries have adopted the Gregorian calendar. The Gregorian calendar is used for most commerce throughout most of the world.</p>
<p>It does happen on occasion that 2 or more events happen in the same year. I use a decimal system on years that have more than one event to place the events in the proper order...you're welcome to do the same when you add events using the ADD tab.</p>

<p>When the desired choices have been made, Press the "Create PDF" button.</p> 

<h1 class="doc">B. ADD</h1>
<p>The Add tab gives everyone the opportunity to add content to my History of the World.</p>
<p>You can view Section A of this document to get an explanation of each field; but there are a few things you should know about the Add tab:</p>
<ol>
   <li>The Add tab is missing the Bible Year. I haven't yet obtained the formula to fill in the Bible Year automatically.</li>
   <li>There are three fields on the Add tab that you don't see anywhere else: Duration, Greg End, Caption and Image. These fields were added to provide compatibility with the SIMILE Timeline widget used in the Chart tab. Duration (when checked) means that there is a corresponding Gregorian End Year (Greg. End) so that in the Chart tab a line will be drawn between the "Year Gregorian" and the "Greg. End" year. If you check Duration be sure to put in a Greg. End year. The Caption field displays its contents in the popup field of the Timeline on the Chart tab. The Image is the URL of an image that will be displayed in the SIMILE Timeline bubble that displays whenever an event is clicked on. NOTE: Be sure that the image URL you select is publickly available to everyone in the world!</li>
  <li>DO NOT USE double quotes in the Caption, Region or Description fields; use single quotes only. This makes exporting the data to the SIMILE Timeline and MySQL databases much easier.</li> 
  <li>The "Submit Form" button will added the new entry to the database. I will then review the entry and (if the entry is approved) will add the Bible Year.</li>
</ol>
<h1 class="doc">C. MAP</h1>
<p>The Map tab provides a geographic context to the History of the World entries. The Map Tab provides a count of entries in each country/region and when clicked, will drill down one level for a closer look. The Map tab can be filtered just like the Browse tab (see section A.1 above).</p>
<h1 class="doc">D. CHART</h1>
<p>The Chart tab (this page) presents a timeline of events using the MIT SIMILE Timeline framework.</p>
<h1 class="doc">D. LEARN</h1>
<p>The Learn tab (this page) documents all of my History's features.</p>
<h1 class="doc">E. SEEK</h1>
<p>The Seek tab  contains useful links for the student of history. I would like to call your attention to two of those links:</p>
<h2 class="doc">E.1. Changelog for This App</h2>
<p>This link leads to an article on my main website that keeps track of the changes I make to my History, including the addition of any historical events.</p>
<h2 class="doc">E.2. Contact Us for any Suggestions, Corrections or Feedback</h2>
<p>This links goes to the Contact Us page of the main website. I get a lot of spam on that email account; so be sure to include "History of the World" in the subject so that I know NOT to delete your message.</p>
